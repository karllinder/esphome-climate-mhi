Custom component to support Mitsubishi Heavy Industries air conditioners as climate IR in ESPHome.

This code is based on remote type RLA502A700K.
The remote was delivered with indoor unit model SRKxxZSW-W.

Also possible to use remote receiver in ESPHome to read out IR commands sent by IR Remote.

To use this, use following config in ESPHome

```yaml
external_components:
  source:
    type: git
    url: https://github.com/karllinder/esphome-climate-mhi
```
Then, add the climate config:

```yaml
remote_receiver:
  id: rcvr
  pin:
    number: GPIOxx
    inverted: true
    mode:
      input: true
      pullup: true

remote_transmitter:
  pin: GPIOxx
  carrier_duty_percent: 50%
  
climate:
   - platform: mhi
     name: "MHI"
     receiver_id: rcvr
```
